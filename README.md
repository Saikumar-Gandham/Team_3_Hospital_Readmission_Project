Introduction:

Hospital readmission occurs when a patient is readmitted shortly after discharge, often due to complications, poor recovery, or inadequate post-discharge care. 
This issue not only burdens healthcare systems but also costs the U.S. over $17 billion annually in preventable readmissions, highlighting gaps in care quality. 
By leveraging predictive models, this project aims to identify high-risk patients, enabling efficient resource allocation, personalized care plans, and extended support to improve outcomes. 
Through the integration of machine learning and advanced techniques, this project addresses a critical real-world problem, demonstrating the transformative power of 
data-driven insights in healthcare.


Research Questions:

1) Can we develop a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of readmission?
   This focuses on using predictive modeling to identify at-risk patients, enabling efficient resource allocation, reducing costs, and improving overall healthcare quality.

2) Can we predict the reason for the readmission?
   This aims to uncover specific reasons for readmissions, supporting targeted interventions, better discharge planning, and enhanced patient care coordination.

   
   
Dataset:

For this project, we have used the MIMIC-III Clinical Dataset. It is a publicly available dataset containing de-identified health information from over 40,000 critical care patients at 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It includes demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, medications, lab results, and clinical notes, enabling research in healthcare and machine learning.
Researchers are required to formally request access via a process documented on the MIMIC website.

There are two key steps that must be completed before access is granted:
1) The researcher must complete a recognized course in protecting human research participants that includes Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.
2) The researcher must sign a data use agreement, which outlines appropriate data usage and security standards, and forbids efforts to identify individual patients.

This Approval requires at least a week. Once an application has been approved the researcher will receive emails containing instructions for downloading the database from PhysioNetWorks, 
a restricted access component of PhysioNet.
